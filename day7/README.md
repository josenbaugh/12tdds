Day 7
=====
As you continue to clean up your old trivia game for the holiday trivia, you've
run the simulation a few times. You've found that once a player goes into the
penalty box they never seem to get out, even if the simulation states they are
getting out.

Task
----
Using the [example code in the language of your choice][1], add a failing test 
that verifies what you've found in the simulations. Then fix the bug and get the 
test to pass.

TDD Tip
-------
Avoid the temptation to test _all_ the code executed when verifying the bug, and
instead _just_ test the bug itself.
