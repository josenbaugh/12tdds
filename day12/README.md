Day 12
======
The last test of the new Christmas holiday trivia you realized that the order of
the questions was the same every time.

Task
----
Using the [example code in the language of your choice][1], add a way to shuffle
the questions and test that they are indeed not in the same order after being 
shuffled.

TDD Tip
-------
Here you're asserting not that things are in a specific order, but that they're 
not.
